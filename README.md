# Rnn-
A brief, engaging one-sentence summary of your project. (e.g., A Python implementation of a Vanilla RNN for Character-Level Text Generation.)


‚ú® OverviewThis repository contains the implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), a class of artificial neural networks designed to process sequential data by maintaining an internal hidden state (or "memory") that captures information from previous steps in the sequence. This makes RNNs ideally suited for tasks where the order and context of data points are crucial.Core Concept: The model applies the same set of weights (parameters) to each step of the sequence, sharing information across time.Key Challenge Addressed: Traditional feedforward networks treat inputs independently, failing to capture dependencies in sequences like text or time series. RNNs overcome this by incorporating memory.‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (The RNN Mechanism)The fundamental operation of an RNN involves iterating through the sequence and updating a hidden state vector $h_t$ at each time step $t$.Hidden State ($h_t$): This is the memory of the network, calculated based on the current input ($x_t$) and the previous hidden state ($h_{t-1}$).$$\mathbf{h}_t = \tanh(\mathbf{W}_{hh}\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{W}_{xh}\mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{b}_h)$$Output ($y_t$): The network's prediction at the current step, derived from the hidden state.$$\mathbf{y}_t = \mathbf{W}_{hy}\mathbf{h}_t + \mathbf{b}_y$$Parameter Sharing: Crucially, the weight matrices ($\mathbf{W}_{hh}, \mathbf{W}_{xh}, \mathbf{W}_{hy}$) are the same for every step $t$.üéØ Applications (What RNNs Excel At)RNNs, and their more advanced variants like LSTM and GRU, are foundational for sequential tasks:ApplicationDescriptionExample FilesNatural Language Processing (NLP)Text generation, sentiment analysis, language modeling.text_generator.pyTime Series ForecastingPredicting stock prices, weather patterns, or sensor readings.stock_predictor.ipynbSpeech RecognitionTranscribing spoken language into text.speech_model.pyMachine TranslationConverting text from one language to another (via Seq2Seq architectures).translator_seq2seq.pyüöÄ Get StartedClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git
