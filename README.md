## ‚ú® Overview: The Power of Sequence Modeling

This repository contains an implementation of a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**, a foundational architecture in deep learning designed specifically to handle **sequential data**. Unlike traditional feedforward networks that treat all inputs as independent, RNNs use an internal **hidden state** (or "memory") to retain information from previous steps in the sequence. This capability is essential for understanding contexts in data like text, audio, and time series.

* **Core Feature:** Parameters (weights) are **shared** across all time steps, allowing the network to learn robust patterns regardless of the sequence length.
* **Sequential Dependence:** The model's output at time $t$ depends not only on the current input $x_t$ but also on the entire history captured in the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the RNN Works (The Core Mechanism)

The "recurrency" is defined by the formula used to update the hidden state $h_t$:

1.  **Hidden State Calculation ($h_t$):** The new memory state is computed using a non-linear activation (like $\tanh$) on a combination of the previous hidden state and the current input.
    $$\mathbf{h}_t = \tanh(\mathbf{W}_{hh}\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{W}_{xh}\mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{b}_h)$$

2.  **Output Calculation ($y_t$):** The final prediction or output is derived from the current hidden state.
    $$\mathbf{y}_t = \mathbf{W}_{hy}\mathbf{h}_t + \mathbf{b}_y$$

* **Key Insight:** This repeated application of the same weights ($\mathbf{W}$) across the sequence is what gives the network its "memory."
